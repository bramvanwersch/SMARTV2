					The user can add an algebraic equation, 
					Save model default by model name]**
## Creating a model
1. Run the ModelView.class
	*You are presented with a prompt including 3 buttons: "Open Experiment","Open model" and "New model".*
		
2. Click the option 'New model'.
	*You are presented with a window with a single text field for the name of the model.  Buttons include "OK" and "Cancel".*

3. type 'test' as the name of your new model and click 'OK'.
*You are presented with the model view. The name of your model is shown in the title bar. In the menu bar there are drop down options for "Model":["New...","Open...","Save..."] and "Experiment":["New...","Open...","Save..."]. Underneath that is a tabbed pane with "Formulas", "Parameters" and "Dependent variables". By default you are in the "Formulas" tab. In the "Formulas" tab you see a textfield for "Dependent variable" and "Equation". On the right hand side, there are buttons to "Add", "Edit" and "Delete" a formula from the formula table. Underneath the text fields, there are two radio buttons for "Equation type": "ODE" and "Algebraic equations". By default, the "ODE" radio button is selected.  Right now the formula table should be empty. On the lower right side, there is a "?" button.*

4. When you see the model window, enter the Dependent variable: 'A' and Equation: "k1++4" and click "Add".
	*Your state "dA/dt" and equation "k1++4" are now shown in the formula table. Appended  to the equation is "(incorrect syntax)".*
	
5. Select the equation in the formula table and click the "Edit" button.
	*On top of the equation field, you can see a label with "Edit mode...".  The State and Equation are shown in the "Dependent variable" and "Equation" text field respectively.*
	
6. Remove a single "+" from the equation and click "OK".
		_The equation "k1+4" for State "A" is now shown in the equation table without the "(incorrect syntax)"._

7. Click on the "Algebraic Equation" radiobutton. and type "B" in the "Dependant variable" field and "A+k2+4" in the "Equation" field.  Next, click "Add".
	*Your state "B" and equation "A+k2+4" are now shown in the formula table.*

8. Click on "Model" -> "Save..." in the menu bar.
	*A file-chooser window appears showing the default directory ./data with the model name in the "Save as:" field and the default file format "Model files". At the bottom of the file-chooser there is a button "Save" and "Cancel".*

9. Click "Save". 
	*The file ./data/test.model is created.*
