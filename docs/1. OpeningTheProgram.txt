When the program is opened it asks the user if he wants to open or make 
a new model. 
- 	When he clicks new model, the user is asked to give the new
	model a name. When he clicks cancel, the model will be untitled. 
	Then the model view opens (see 2. ModelView.txt). 
-	When he clicks open model, the program opens a model file chooser
	(see 3. ModelOpening&Saving.txt).
