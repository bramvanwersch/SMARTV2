Model Help:

Ode tab:
-For adding ordinary differential equations to your model.
-Parameter t is predefined as time.
-Possible operators; +, -, *, /, (, ), ^(power), **(power).
-Special functions; sin(x), tan(x), cos(x), log(x), ln(x), sqrt(x), log2(x), log10(x).
-Special parameter; t = time at step.
-Incorrect syntax; appended to formulas the program does not support.

Parameter tab:
-For adding parameters manually or checking what parameters the program has identified in the current model
-Only unbound parameters can be deleted.
-Unbound; Parameters are not yet included in any formula.

State tab:
-For seeing what states the program has identified in the current model.

Equation tab:
-For adding normal equations or constants to your model.
-for operators see Ode tab.
